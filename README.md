## Title of the project:  
Real Time Flight Tracker
## Description of the project:
In this project tracked and traced a flight's realtime path based on user search. Used custom image.
## How to Run: 
We need to get the api key from airlabs website. I couldn't share mine as there is a limit of accessing the data. When we keep a valid apikey, it starts pulling real time flight data. User needs to enter flight number in the input box and click Find Flight Path button. We need to zoom in to see more icons added along the way, or set time interval for longer time, so the distance between each image will be visible with out zoom in. NOTE: Realtime flight tracker works for the flights which are in the air at the time of tracking. We can find flight number in the itinerary.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
Try to update coordinates of map every once in a while to track international flight. Try to track more flights in a given area.I will be adding popup to the icon and a line between the images.
