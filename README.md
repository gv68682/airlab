## Title of the project:  
Real Time Flight Tracker
## Description of the project:
In this project tracked and traced a flight's realtime path. Used custom image.
## How to Run: 
We need to get the api key from airlabs website. I couldn't share mine as there is a limit of accessing the data. When we keep a valid apikey, it starts pulling real time flight data. We need to zoom in to see more icons added along the way, or set time interval for longer time, so the distance between each image will be visible with out zoom in.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
Try to update coordinates every once in a while to track international flight. Try to track more flights in a given area. We can track a flight based on users input will be a good improvement.
